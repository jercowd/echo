# metroidvania - 2D Platformer

This is a 2D platformer game built using **TypeScript** and **Kaboom.js**, where the player must navigate through interconnected rooms to escape a factory. Inspired by Metroidvania-style games, the project features dynamic room transitions, player controls, and interactive elements like enemies and notifications, making for an engaging gameplay experience.

## Features

- **Room transitions**: Move between different factory rooms, each loaded from custom JSON maps.
- **Player controls**: Use arrow keys to move, `X` to jump, and `Z` to attack.
- **Dynamic scenes**: Manage state across multiple scenes, including intro and final exit sequences.
- **Notification system**: Displays key information and instructions to guide the player.
- **Audio integration**: Audio is activated when the game starts, adding depth to the player experience.

1. **Start Screen**: The game begins with an intro scene that provides instructions and starts the game when the player presses Enter.
2. **Room Exploration**: Navigate through different rooms while interacting with the environment.
3. **Final Scene**: Upon escaping the factory, the game ends with a final notification.
